## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Describe what you want to visualize in plain English
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, scatter plots, histograms
- **File Format Support**: CSV and Excel files (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Powered by Plotly for responsive, interactive charts
- **Data Analysis**: Automatic data type detection and missing value handling
- **Export Options**: Save charts as PNG images or interactive HTML files
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive web interface built with Streamlit

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haix02/Visualio.git
cd Visualio
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Upload Your Data**: Choose a CSV or Excel file using the file uploader
2. **Explore Your Data**: View data summary, column types, and preview
3. **Create Visualizations**: Type natural language commands to generate charts
4. **Export Results**: Download your charts as PNG or HTML files

### Example Commands

- `"Show sales by region as a pie chart"`
- `"Trend of revenue over time"`
- `"Compare product categories using bar chart"`
- `"Show correlation between price and quantity"`
- `"Distribution of values in age column"`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

The application consists of four main modules:

- **`app.py`**: Main Streamlit application and user interface
- **`data_processor.py`**: Data loading, cleaning, and type detection
- **`nlp_parser.py`**: Natural language command parsing and interpretation
- **`chart_generator.py`**: Chart creation and styling using Plotly

## üìä Supported Chart Types

| Chart Type | Use Case | Example Command |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| Bar Chart | Compare categories | "Compare sales by product" |
| Pie Chart | Show proportions | "Distribution of customers by region" |
| Line Chart | Show trends over time | "Revenue trend over months" |
| Scatter Plot | Show correlations | "Relationship between price and sales" |
| Histogram | Show distributions | "Distribution of customer ages" |

## üîß Configuration

### Dependencies
